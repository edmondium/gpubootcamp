| Lab      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [N-Ways](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/nways_accelerated_programming)      | This Bootcamp will cover multiple GPU programming models and choose the one that best fits your needs. The material supports different programming langauges including C ( CUDA C, OpenACC C, OpenMP C, C++ stdpar ),  Fortran ( CUDA Fortran, OpenACC Fortran, OpenMP Fortran, ISO DO CONCURRENT ) Python ( Numba, CuPy )       |
| [Multi GPU Programming Model](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/nways_multi_gpu)   | This bootcamp will cover scaling applications to multiple GPUs across multiple nodes. Moreover, understanding of the underlying technologies and communication topology will help us utilize high-performance NVIDIA libraries to extract more performance out of the system     |
| [HPC Profiler](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/HPC_Profiler)  | This repository contains learning materials and exercises for NVIDIA Nsight Tools. Goal is to learn how to profile your application with NVIDIA Nsight Systems,Compute and NVTX API calls to find performance limiters and bottlenecks and apply incremental parallelization strategies |
| [C++ Standard Parallelism](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/cpp_hpc_tutorial)  | This repository contains learning materials and exercises for C++ Standard Parallelism. The content covers step by steps of accelerating a portable HPC application with CPUs and GPUs using the parallelism and concurrency features of the C++17 and C++20 standards. Goal is to learn about C++ concurrency features like threads, atomics, barriers, and parallel algorithms. This forked content has been tested. The 
| [End to End AI for Science](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-AI-for-Science)      | This bootcamp provides a step-by-step overview of the fundamentals of deep neural networks, walks attendees through the hands-on experience of building and improving deep learning models using a framework that uses the fundamental laws of physics to model the behavior of complex systems, and enables attendees to visualize the physically accurate outputs of the trained model in near real-time. |
| [End to End Computer Vision](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-Computer-Vision)      |  This repository contains the material for the end-to-end computer vision bootcamp, the goal of which is to build a complete end-to-end computer vision pipeline for an object detection application. This bootcamp will introduce participants to multiple NVIDIA® SDKs, most notably NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, NVIDIA TensorRT™, NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server, and NVIDIA DeepStream SDK. Participants will also have hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, optimization, and deployment at scale   |
| [AI Profiler](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/AI-Profiler)   |  Learn how optimizing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) training using profiling tools    |
| [End to End NLP](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-NLP)  | This repository contains the material for the End-To-End NLP bootcamp, the goal of which is to build a complete end-to-end NLP pipeline for Question Answering application. This bootcamp will introduce participants to multiple NVIDIA® SDKs, most notably NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and NVIDIA RIVA. Participants will also have hands-on experience in SQuAD data preprocessing, BERT model training, optimization, and deployment at scale. |
