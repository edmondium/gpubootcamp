# Nways to GPU programming
This repository contains mini applications for GPU Bootcamps (**Tested on NVIDIA driver 440.82**). This bootcamp comprises N-Ways to GPU programming implemented with the following programming approaches:

**C programming language**
  - std::par
  - OpenACC
  - OpenMP
  - CUDA
  
**Fortran programming language**
  - do-concurrent
  - OpenACC
  - OpenMP
  - CUDA
  
  
**Python programming language**
  - CuPy
  - Numba

We showcase above ways using mini applications in domains like Molecular Dynamics, Computational Fluid Dynamics etc.

## Target Audience:

The target audience for this bootcamp are researchers/graduate students and developers who are interested in learning about various ways of GPU programming to accelerate their scientific applications. Basic experience with C/C++ or Python or Fortran programming is needed. No GPU programming knowledge is required.

## Tutorial Duration

N-Ways bootcamp is designed to be modular and the participants can choose one of the ways to go through the contents in this bootcamp: 

- Depth Learning: Choose one of the GPU programming approach and dive deep with optimaztion techniques.  This approach is recommended for developers who have already decided to use a programming approach and want to learn best practises for same. e.g. Learn different features of OpenACC C and  apply best programming practise to application.
- Breadth Learning: Cover at high level all the N-Ways to GPU programming. This approach is recommended for developers starting with GPU programming and yet to converge on the best available option to port to GPU.

Individual labs in the bootcamp take 1 hour each and based on path chosen total Bootcamp can take approximate 8 hours. 


## Prerequisites:
To run this tutorial you will need a machine with NVIDIA GPU.

- Install the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/]).
- Install Nvidia toolkit, [Nsight Systems (latest version)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems) and [compute (latest version)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute).

## Creating containers
To start with, you will have to build a Docker or Singularity container.

### Docker Container
To build a docker container for **C & Fortran**, run:

`sudo docker build -t <imagename>:<tagnumber> .`

For instance :


`sudo docker build -t myimage:1.0 .`

While in the case of **Python**, you have to specify the dockerfile name using flag **"-f"**, therefore run:

`sudo docker build -f <dockerfile name> -t <imagename>:<tagnumber> .`

For example :

`sudo docker build -f Dockerfile_python -t myimage:1.0 .`


For C, Fortran, and Python, the code labs have been written using Jupyter lab and a Dockerfile has been built to simplify deployment. In order to serve the docker instance for a student, it is necessary to expose port 8000 from the container. For example, the following command would expose port 8000 inside the container as port 8000 on the lab machine:

`sudo docker run --rm -it --gpus=all -p 8888:8888 myimage:1.0`

When this command is run, you can browse to the serving machine on port 8888 using any web browser to access the labs. For instance, from if they are running on the local machine the web browser should be pointed to http://localhost:8888. The `--gpus` flag is used to enable `all` NVIDIA GPUs during container runtime. The `--rm` flag is used to clean an temporary images created during the running of the container. The `-it` flag enables killing the jupyter server with `ctrl-c`. This command may be customized for your hosting environment.


Then, inside the container launch the Jupyter lab assigning the port you opened:

`jupyter-lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser --allow-root`


Once inside the container, open the jupyter lab in browser: http://localhost:8888, and start the lab by clicking on the `START_nways.ipynb` notebook.

### Singularity Container

To build the singularity container for **C & Fortran**, run: 

`singularity build nways.simg Singularity`

While in the case of **Python**, run:

`singularity build nways.simg Singularity_python`

Thereafter, for C, Fortran, and Python, copy the files to your local machine to make sure changes are stored locally:

`singularity run nways.simg cp -rT /labs ~/labs`

Then, run the container:

`singularity run --nv nways.simg jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=~/labs`

Once inside the container, open the jupyter lab in browser: http://localhost:8888, and start the lab by clicking on the `nways_start.ipynb` notebook.
