    "The **goal** of this lab is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Give brief introduction to Kokkos Framework and its usage\n",
    "- Understand the steps for making a sequential code parallel using Kokkos Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not intend to cover:\n",
    "- Detailed optimization techniques and all the components of Kokkos Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Kokkos\n",
    "Kokkos is a productive, portable, performant, shared-memory programming model.\n",
    "- It is a C++ library, not a new language or language extension\n",
    "- Let's you write algorithms once and run on many architectures, e.g. multi-core CPU, NVIDIA GPU, Xeon Phi, etc.\n",
    "- Solves the data layout problem by using multi-dimensional arrays with architecture-dependent layouts to achieve performance portability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kokkos Abstractions\n",
    "\n",
    "Kokkos fundamentally works on the principle of separation of concern. It decouples two concepts which helps it to achieve Performance Portability. The first being abstract machine model which describes fundamental concepts required for the development of future portable and performant high performance computing applications. The second is a concrete instantiation of the programming this model written in C++, which allows programmers to write to the concept machine model. It is important to decouple these two entities because the underlying model being used by Kokkos could, in the future, be instantiated in additional languages beyond. The diagram given below shows abstractions provided by Kokkos to achieve the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/kokkos_ecosystem.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, please checkout this [Kokkos Tutorial](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/presentation/s7344-christian-trott-Kokkos.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kokkos programming model is characterized by 6 core abstractions: Execution Spaces, Execution Patterns, Execution Policies, Memory Spaces, Memory Layout and Memory Traits. These abstraction concepts allow the formulation of generic algorithms\n",
    "and data structures which can then be mapped to different types of architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be providing brief introduction to Kokkos abstraction necessary for us to get started and run our code on GPU using Kokkos library in this tutorial. We do not intend to cover Memory Layout and Memory Traits in this tutorial which may be essential to get best performance on our code. Participants are recommended to go through reference section below and  can optimize the code further.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts of threaded data parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will introduce you to core abstractions and concepts in Kokkos based on which we will port the **Pair Calculation algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern**: In Kokkos, *Execution Patterns* are the fundamental parallel algorithms in which an application has to be expressed. To list a few:\n",
    "- parallel_for: Dispatches a parallel \"for loop\" with independent iterations. We will be using this pattern during our porting exercise\n",
    "- parallel_reduce: Combines a parallel_for execution with a reduction operation,\n",
    "- parallel_scan: Combines a parallel_for operation with a prefix or postfix scan on output values of each operation, and\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Policy:**  An Execution Policy defines how computations are executed (static scheduling, dynamic scheduling etc.) For example the most simple form of execution policies are _Range Policies_. They are used to execute an operation once for each element in a range. We will be using this policy in our code. On the other hand _Team policies_ are used to implement hierarchical parallelism. You will see that CUDA Programming model is hierarchical in nature. In fact CUDA programming model inspired Kokkos' thread team model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Body:** Consists of code which performs each unit of work (e.g. the loop body)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern and policy together drive the computational body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows these three concepts in a sequential code. In our code we will choosing one among the available patterns and execution policies to run in parallel on GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/kokkos_abstraction.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Kokkos supports multiple patterns and Execution policies. The capabilities listed below will be required for you to be familiar with in order to move a serial code to a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Loops:\n",
    "Parallel loop pattern maps the work to computation unit core where \n",
    "- Each iteration of a computational body is a unit of work.\n",
    "- An iteration index identifies a particular unit of work.\n",
    "- An iteration range identifies a total amount of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Kokkos::parallel_for to map the work to cores: ```parallel_for ( ... );```\n",
    "\n",
    "```parallel_for``` is the most common parallel dispatch operation. It corresponds to the OpenMP construct ```#pragma omp parallel for```. Parallel_for splits the index range over the available hardware resources and executes the loop body in parallel. Each iteration is executed independently. Kokkos promises nothing about the loop order or the amount of work which actually runs concurrently. This means in particular that not all loop iterations are active at the same time \n",
    "\n",
    "The two key ways of writing computational bodies are: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Functor Based** : Functor is a common pattern used in C++ and sample code below demonstrates the use of functor. If you are new to functors don't worry. They are nothing but structures with function which overloads the () operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "struct ParallelFunctor {\n",
    "...\n",
    "    void operator ()( a work assignment based on index) const {\n",
    "        /* ... computational body ... */\n",
    "...\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "A sample code of usage of functor for daxpy (```y = a*x + y```) operation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "//Define functor with member variable\n",
    "struct Functor {\n",
    "    double *_x , *_y , _a;\n",
    "    Functor (x, y, a) :\n",
    "        _x(x), _y(y), _a(a) {}\n",
    "    void operator ()( const size_t i) {\n",
    "        _y [i] = _a * _x [i] + _y [i ];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "//Call functor by creating an object and calling parallel_for\n",
    "Functor functor ( x , y, a );\n",
    "Kokkos :: parallel_for ( vector_size , functor );\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**C++11 Lambda** : Lambdas were first introduced in C++11 and are a very concise way of writing code. Basically Lambdas are compiler generated functors you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample usage of Lambdas for our example is shown above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp \n",
    "double * x = new double [N ]; // also y\n",
    "parallel_for (N , [=] ( const size_t i) {\n",
    "    y[i ] = a * x[i] + y[i ];\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Kokkos lets users choose whether to use a functor or a lambda. Lambdas are convenient for short loop bodies. For a much more complicated loop body, you might find it easier for testing to separate it out and name it as a functor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution space defines where the parallel code will run. Types of Execution spaces include: Serial, Threads, OpenMP, CUDA, ROCm. Execution space can be defined either at compile time or run time as part of the policy. If none specified it will run in a default execution policy set during compilation of the Kokkos Core library. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Spaces are the places where data resides. They specify physical location of data as well as certain access  characteristics. Different physical locations correspond to things such as high bandwidth memory, on die scratch memory or non-volatile bulk storage. Different logical memory spaces allow for concepts such as UVM memory in the CUDA programming model, which is accessible from Host and GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code sample above both x,y arrays reside in a CPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way of storing data (multidimensional arrays) which can be communicated to an accelerator (GPU). This is done via _views_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Views:** Views are a lightweight C++ class with a pointer to array data and some meta-data. \n",
    "- Or a simple definition could be that Views are *like pointers* and needs to be copied inside functor.\n",
    "- Views are multi dimensions and the dimensions are fixed at compile time\n",
    "\n",
    "For the daxpy code here is how the Views will get created.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "View < double *, ... > x (...) , y (...);\n",
    "    //... populate x , y ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "parallel_for (N , [=] ( const size_t i) {\n",
    "    // Views x and y are captured by value ( copy )\n",
    "    y(i ) = a * x(i) + y(i );\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "Every view stores its data in a memory space set at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp \n",
    "View<double***,MemorySpace> data(...); \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If none specified it will chose the default execution policy. Since views are similar to pointers, we need to perform deep copies explicitly (unless we are making use of UVM: [Unified Virtual Memory Space](../GPU_Architecture_Terminologies.ipynb) supported by CUDA). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we intend to use explicit copies. The example below demonstrates that *view* resides in the Default Execution space while we create a mirror which resides in the host execution space. Then we can copy data back and forth between two views using the *deep_copy* API.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "//Define a View pointing to default execution space.\n",
    "typedef Kokkos :: View < double ** > ViewType ;\n",
    "ViewType view (...);\n",
    "\n",
    "//Create a Host Mirror of View\n",
    "ViewType :: HostMirror hostView = Kokkos :: createmirrorview ( view );\n",
    "\n",
    "// copying from host to device\n",
    "Kokkos::deep_copy(view, host_view); \n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "// copying from device to host\n",
    "Kokkos::deep_copy(host_view,view); \n",

    "## Kokkos Initialization and Finalize\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Kokkos an initialization call is required. That call is responsible for acquiring hardware resources such as threads. Typically, this call should be placed right at the start of a program\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to initialize Kokkos is by calling the following function:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "Kokkos::initialize(int& argc, char* argv[]); \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each program, Kokkos needs to be shut down in order to free resources; do this by calling \n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "Kokkos::finalize()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Atomic Construct\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code you will also require one more construct which will help you in getting the right results. Kokkos atomic construct ensures that a particular variable is accessed and/or updated atomically to prevent indeterminate results and race conditions. In other words, it prevents one thread from stepping on the toes of other threads due to accessing a variable simultaneously, resulting in different results run-to-run. For example, if I want to count the number of elements that have a value greater than zero, we could write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "if ( val > 0 )\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Kokkos::atomic_increment(&cnt));\n",
