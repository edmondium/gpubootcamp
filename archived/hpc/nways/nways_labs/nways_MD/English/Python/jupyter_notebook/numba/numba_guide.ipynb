    "##  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numba** is a just-in-time compiler for python that converts python functions into optimized machine code at runtime. In other words, user-defined functions written in python would be run at native machine code speed. For example, a programmer can delegate functions that are computationally intensive (especially those with consecutive nested loops and arrays) within his/her code to Numba execution and gain speed up. This is achievable by placing Numba decorator at the top of a user-define function. A Numba decorator determines how a function would be compiled, and more on it would be explained later in the notebook. Numba has huge support for NumPy library and also enables parallel programming on `CPU (multicore) and GPU (via CUDA API binding)`, thus, making execution on NumPy arrays faster. Our focus would be using `Numba for CUDA GPU`, therefore, parallel programming concept would be described from CUDA C kernel perspective. The rest of the notebook include frequently used terms like **Host** (this refers to a CPU), **Device** (means a GPU), and **Kernel** (a user-defined function that runs on the GPU with Numba decorator specified at the top).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "When written codes run on the device (GPU), execution is shared amongst threads and blocks of memory space. The execution could be mapped to thousands of threads modelled in blocks and grids form. This idea is illustrated in figure 1.0 with a view that a thread can be seen as a single executing unit on the device.  A `thread block` (also known as a block) is as collection of threads that can communicate, while a collection of these blocks is referred to as a `Grid`. In several devices the maximum number of threads within a thread block is `1,024` and `65,535` blocks within a grid.\n",

    " \n",
    " As shown in figure 2.0, the GPU memory space is hierarchically arranged into `shared memory`, `local memory`, `global memory`, `constant memory`, and `texture memory`. Within a block, each thread has its own local memory and register and does communicate with other threads using the shared memory.\n",

    "## Numba CUDA Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This section highlights steps in writing your first CUDA Kernel in Numba. The steps are illustrated using a simple task as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**: Write a Numba Kernel program that adds two arrays A and B and stores the result in array C. Assume A and B contain 10,000 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: \n",
    " - First, import `numba.cuda as cuda` library at the top of your notebook in order to access `cuda.jit`. \n",
    " - Next, write an empty python function and specify `@cuda.jit` at the top of the function. An example is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numba.cuda as cuda\n",
    "@cuda.jit\n",
    "def <function_name>(<arguments>):\n",
    "    #...code body ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Write code body**: To successfully write the kernel code body, it is important to know that computations within CUDA kernels execute in thread blocks and grids in a way that input array elements are accessed using global thread id as index. Therefore, it is necessary to uniquely identify distinct threads. A simple illustration on how to estimate global thread `id(s)` is given in figure 3.0 using four blocks of threads stacked over each other to form a matrix in rows and columns arrangement. Global thread ids are calculated in `x-dimension` (ideally thread block are in x,y,z dimensions) by rearranging the thread blocks as single row and then estimate using statement below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tid = cuda.threadIdx.x + cuda.blockIdx.x * cuda.blockDim.x\n",
    "```\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../images/thread_position.png\" height=\"400px\" width=\"400px\"/></center>\n",
    "<center><div>Figure 3.0 Estimating thread id for threads in green and orange</div></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to compute thread ids, we can proceed to write the kernel body code as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numba.cuda as cuda\n",
    "N = 10000 #initialize array size\n",
    "@cuda.jit\n",
    "def Add_arrays(d_A, d_B, d_C):\n",
    "\ttid = cuda.threadIdx.x + cuda.blockIdx.x * cuda.blockDim.x\n",
    "    if tid < N: #ensuring that index is not out of bound\n",
    "        d_C[tid] = d_A[tid] + d_B[tid]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that kernel function does not return value through variable but stream/copy back from the Device to the Host.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write the Host code**: The first thing to do is to initialize your input arrays as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "h_A = np.arange(N, dtype=np.int32)\n",
    "h_B = np.arange(N, dtype=np.int32)\n",
    "h_C = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.int32) #initialize zero filled array\n",
    "````\n",
    "Do data transfer by copying data (input array) from the `Host` to the `Device` using `cuda.to_device()` function. \n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "d_A = cuda.to_device(h_A)\n",
    "d_B = cuda.to_device(h_B)\n",
    "d_C = cuda.to_device(h_C)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Attention!!!** Numba Kernels automatically have direct access to NumPy arrays residing on the Host thus, explicitly stating `cuda.to_device()` is may not be required for data visibility to the Device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to call the kernel function from the Host. But before that, a vital move would be to initialize the number of threads that would make up a single block (thread block) so that number of blocks required in a grid to execute the `Add_array` Kernel can be estimated. In Numba, Kernel calls have a definition pattern as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<kernel_name> [ <num_of_blocks_per_grid>, <num_of_threads_per_block>] (<arguments>)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of threads required is equivalent to the size of initialized array, which is 10,000, therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "num_of_threads_per_block = 256 # this has not exceed the limit i.e < 1024 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, `num_of_blocks_per_grid` can be estimated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "num_of_blocks_per_grid = math.ceil(N / num_of_threads_per_block)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, `Add_arrays` Kernel function can be called this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Add_arrays[num_of_blocks_per_grid , num_of_threads_per_block](d_A, d_B, d_C)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy result from Device to Host using `copy_to_host()` function, thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "h_C = d_C.copy_to_host()\n",
    "````\n",
    "You can run the entire code in the below."

In the second approach, each array would fit into a thread block as `4x4` and block per grid would be `1x1(1 grid)`.
