    "Now that you are familiar with the PINNs and the Modulus library, let's solve a fluid mechanics problem involving solution to the Navier Stokes equations. The problem is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2D chip is placed inside a 2D channel. The flow enters inlet (a parabolic profile is used with $u_{max}=1.5\\text{ m/s}$) and exits through the outlet which is a $0 Pa$. All the other walls are treated as no-slip. The kinematic viscosity $(\\nu)$ for the flow is $0.02 \\text{ }m^2/s$ and the density $(\\rho)$ is $1 \\text{ }kg/m^3$. The problem is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "The objectives of this problem are following:\n",
    "1. [Fluid Flow](Challenge_1_template.ipynb) Use PINNs to solve the fluid flow for the given geometry and flow parameters\n",
    "2. [Parameterized](Challenge_2_template.ipynb) Use PINNs to solve the parameterized problem by varying the chip's geometry (width and height)\n",
    "3. [Inverse Problem](Challenge_3_template.ipynb) Use PINNs along with the OpenFOAM data to solve the inverse problem of finding the viscosity of the flow, given the flow field data \n",
