# openacc-training-materials
This repository contains mini applications for GPU Bootcamps. The objective of this bootcamp is to give an introduction to application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in Science ( High Performance Computing(HPC) Simulations ). This Bootcamp will introduce  fundamentals of AI and how they can be applied to CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)

- Introduction to AI and Convolution Neural Network with Keras
- Using AI for Steady State Flow using Neural Networks

## Target Audience:

The target audience for this bootcamp are researchers/graduate students and developers who are new to field of Artifical Intelligence and interested in learning about how it can be applied to Simulation domains like Computational Fluid Dynamics. Basic Python programming knowledge is required. 

## Tutorial Duration

The overall bootcamp will take approximately 3 hours. There is an additional mini-challenge provided at the end of bootcamp.


## Prerequisites:
To run this tutorial you will need a machine with NVIDIA GPU.

- Install the latest [Docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/).

Make sure both Docker and Singularity has been installed with NVIDIA GPU support

- The base containers required for the lab may require users to create a NGC account and generate an API key (https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-catalog-user-guide/index.html#registering-activating-ngc-account)

## Creating containers
To start with, you will have to build a Docker or Singularity container.

### Docker Container
To build a docker container, run: 
`sudo docker build --network=host -t <imagename>:<tagnumber> .`

For instance:
`sudo docker build --network=host -t myimage:1.0 .`

and to run the container, run:
`sudo docker run --rm -it --gpus=all --network=host -p 8888:8888 myimage:1.0`

The container launches jupyter lab and runs on port 8888
`jupyter-lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser --allow-root`

Then, open the jupyter lab in browser: http://localhost:8888
Start working on the lab by clicking on the `Start_Here.ipynb` notebook.

### Singularity Container

To build the singularity container, run: 
`sudo singularity build <image_name>.simg Singularity`

and copy the files to your local machine to make sure changes are stored locally:
`singularity run <image_name>.simg cp -rT /workspace ~/workspace`

Then, run the container:
`singularity run --nv <image_name>.simg jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=~/workspace/python/jupyter_notebook`

Then, open the jupyter lab in browser: http://localhost:8888
Start working on the lab by clicking on the `Start_Here.ipynb` notebook.

## Troubleshooting

Q. cuDNN failed to initialize or GPU out of memory error

A. This error occurs when the user forgot to shutdown the jupyter kernel of previously run notebooks. Please make sure that all the previous notebook jupyter kernel is shutdown. ( Go to Home Tab --> Click Running Tab--> Kill notebooks that arenâ€™t being used )

Q. Cannot write to /tmp directory

A. Some notebooks depend on writing logs to /tmp directory. While creating container make sure /tmp director is accesible with write permission to container. Else the user can also change the tmp directory location

Q. "ResourceExhaustedError" error is observed while running the labs
A. Currently the batch size and network model is set to consume 16GB GPU memory. In order to use the labs without any modifications it is recommended to have GPU with minimum 16GB GPU memory. Else the users can play with batch size to reduce the memory footprint
