    "*Quoted from the previous notebook* : If we take a closer look at the results, we can find even after 8 epochs in both cases, the run with a single GPU at the end of 8 epochs has a **loss of 0.0487 and accuracy of 0.9851** , comparing that with 8 GPU case, we find at the end of 8 epochs we have a **loss of 0.3582 and accuracy of 0.8957**.\n",

    "To understand this phenomenon, a term called as Critical batch size was coined in the paper **An Empirical Model of Large-Batch Training** by **Sam McCandlish, Jared Kaplan, Dario Amodei, OpenAI Dota Team**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Critical batch size \n",
    "\n",
    "Critical batch size is when compute efficiency drops below 50% optimal and larger batch sizes yield diminishing returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is found that we can approximately predict the maximum useful batch size by measuring gradient noise scaling, which is a simple statistic that quantifies the signal-to-noise ratio of the network gradients. Heuristically, the noise scale measures the variation in the data as seen by the model (at a given stage in training). When the noise scale is small, looking at a lot of data in parallel quickly becomes redundant, whereas when it is large, we can still learn a lot from huge batches of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Impact on test and validation accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "It is found that test/validation accuracy decreases with an increase in Batch size. This is noticeable in our previous notebook as well from the figure below in the paper **ImageNet Training in Minutes** by `Yang You, Zhao Zhang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, James Demmel, and Kurt Keutzer` \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/accuracy.png\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of generalization ability is because large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training function. These minimizers are characterized by a significant number of large positive eigenvalues in $\\nabla^2 f(x)$ , and tend to generalize less well. In contrast, small-batch methods converge to flat minimizers characterized by having numerous small eigenvalues of $\\nabla^2 f(x)$. We have observed that the loss function landscape of deep neural networks is such that large-batch methods are attracted to regions with sharp minimizers. Unlike small-batch methods, are unable to escape basins of attraction of these minimizers.\n",

    "<center><img src=\"images/minima.png\" width=\"600\"/></center>\n",

Nonetheless, since it uses batch statistics, it is bounded to depend on the chosen batch size.

This modification by itself reduces the generalization error substantially.\n",

    "#### The LAMB Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of optimizers have been created to address this problem and allow for scaling to very large batch sizes and learning rates. One such optimizer is the LAMB optimizer. LAMB uses a layerwise adaptive large batch optimization to train with very little hyperparameter tuning. This optimizer enables the use of very large batch sizes without any degradation of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement LAMB using the following lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import LAMB from Tensorflow Addons\n",
    "from tensorflow_addons.optimizers import LAMB\n",
    "\n",
    "# Replace the Adam optimizer with LAMB:\n",
    "opt = LAMB(learning_rate=scaled_lr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now train using the LAMB optimizer and compare the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the LAMB optimizer from its paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00962.pdf)"
