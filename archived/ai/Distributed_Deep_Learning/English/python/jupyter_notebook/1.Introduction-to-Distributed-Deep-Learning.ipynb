    "Artificial Intelligence has witnessed tremendous progress in the past decade, making its impact in almost every potential field. Still, the concepts for the backbone of Neural networks such as Perceptron, backpropagation were published in 1958 and 1974 respectively. They were not widespread because of the unavailability of computing power and lack of data transfer and storage systems. The introduction of the Internet and the recent improvements in compute have both been a key component of AI progress in recent times, with [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) being the leader in AI progress in the modern world.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the recent advancements in computing power, modern Deep neural networks are capable of processing a wide variety of data. They can do a wide range of tasks, but these Deep learning workloads have also significantly grown in size. This makes deep learning applications time-intensive for larger workloads.\n",

    "- [AMP](https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision): Deep Neural Network training has traditionally relied on IEEE single-precision format. However, you can train with mixed precision with half-precision while maintaining the network accuracy achieved with single precision. This technique of using both `single` and `half-precision` representations is referred to as the mixed-precision technique. The benefits are : \n",
    "    - Speeds up math-intensive operations, such as linear and convolution layers, using [NVIDIA Tensor Cores](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/tensor-cores/).\n",
    "    - Speeds up memory-limited operations by accessing half the bytes compared to single-precision.\n",

    "- [NVIDIA Tensor Cores](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/tensor-cores/): Tensor Cores enable mixed-precision computing, dynamically adapting calculations to accelerate throughput while preserving accuracy. The latest generation expands these speedups to a full range of workloads. From 10X speedups in AI training with Tensor Float 32 (TF32), a revolutionary new precision, to 2.5X boosts for high-performance computing with floating-point 64 (FP64)"

    "\n",
    "- **Training**: This is the widely used case for distributed deep learning called distributed Training. When the computing power needed for model convergence gets higher, multiples GPUs are then used to increase parallelism and thus reduce the training time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inference**: Deep learning inference is the process of using a trained DNN model to make predictions against previously unseen data. Distributed inferencing is used in applications that require low latency and high throughput. One such example is running Inference on multiple video streams on an Intelligent Video Analytics application built with [NVIDIA DeepStream SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk). \n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/model_parallelism.jpg\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Parallelism**: In modern deep learning, when the dataset is too big to be fit into the memory, we could only do stochastic gradient descent for batches. The shortcoming of stochastic gradient descent is that the estimate of the gradients might not accurately represent the true gradients of using the full dataset. Therefore, it may take much longer to converge. A natural way to have a more accurate estimate of the gradients is to use larger batch sizes or even use the full dataset. To allow this, the gradients of small batches are calculated on each GPU. The final estimate of the gradients is the weighted average of the gradients calculated from all the small batches. \n",
