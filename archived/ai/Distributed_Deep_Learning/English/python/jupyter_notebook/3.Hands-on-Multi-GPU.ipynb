    "## Tensorflow - Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow uses `tf.distribute.Strategy` API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes. `tf.distribute.Strategy` can be used with a high-level API like **Keras**, and can also be used to distribute custom training loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow Strategies can be briefly summarised into two axes : \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous vs asynchronous** training: \n",
    "    - In sync training, all workers train over different slices of input data in sync and aggregate gradients at each step. \n",
    "    - In async training, all workers are independently training over the input data and updating variables asynchronously. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware platform**: You may want to scale your training onto multiple GPUs on one machine, or multiple machines in a network (with 0 or more GPUs each), or on Cloud TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to support these use cases, there are 6 strategies available. Here is a short description of the strategies :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MirroredStrategy**\n",
    "    - `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` supports synchronous distributed training on multiple GPUs on one machine. It creates one replica per GPU device. Each variable in the model is mirrored across all the replicas. Together, these variables form a single conceptual variable called MirroredVariable. These variables are kept in sync with each other by applying identical updates.\n",
    "- **MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy**\n",
    "    - `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` is very similar to MirroredStrategy. It implements synchronous distributed training across multiple workers, each with potentially multiple GPUs. Similar to `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`, it creates copies of all variables in the model on each device across all workers.\n",
    "    - **Note** : For multi-worker training, you need to set up the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable for each binary running in your cluster. The `TF_CONFIG` environment variable is a JSON string which specifies what tasks constitute a cluster, their addresses and each task's role in the cluster.\n",
    "- **TPUStrategy**\n",
    "    - `tf.distribute.TPUStrategy` lets you run your TensorFlow training on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n",
    "- **CentralStorageStrategy**\n",
    "    - `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy` does synchronous training as well. Variables are not mirrored, instead they are placed on the CPU and operations are replicated across all local GPUs. If there is only one GPU, all variables and operations will be placed on that GPU.\n",
    "- **OneDeviceStrategy**\n",
    "    - `tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy` is a strategy to place all variables and computation on a single specified device.\n",
    "- **ParameterServerStrategy**\n",
    "    - Parameter server training is a common data-parallel method to scale up model training on multiple machines. A parameter server training cluster consists of workers and parameter servers. Variables are created on parameter servers and they are read and updated by workers in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow by default uses [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) for communication between GPUs. Kindly refer to the [System Topology Notebook](2.1.System-Topology.ipynb#NCCL) to learn more about NCCL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've given an overview of Tensorflow and the available functionalities let us try out an example using **MirroredStrategy**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be building a small CNN and train it on the **FMNIST dataset**."

    "## Horovod\n",
    "\n",
    "Horovod is a distributed deep learning training framework. It is available for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horovod is an open-source tool initially developed by Uber to support their need for faster deep learning model training across many engineering teams. It is part of a growing ecosystem of approaches to distributed training, including for example, Distributed TensorFlow. Uber decided to develop a solution that utilised MPI for distributed process communication, and the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) for its highly optimised implementation of reductions across distributed processes and nodes. The resulting Horovod package delivers on its promise to scale deep learning model training across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes, with only minor code modification and intuitive debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Horovod's MPI Roots\n",
    "\n",
    "Horovod's connection to MPI runs deep, and for programmers familiar with MPI programming, much of what you program to distribute model training with Horovod will feel very familiar. For those unfamiliar with MPI programming, a brief discussion of some of the conventions and considerations required when distributing processes with Horovod, or MPI, is worthwhile. Horovod, as with MPI, strictly follows the Single-Program Multiple-Data (SPMD) paradigm where we implement the instruction flow of multiple processes in the same file/program. Because multiple processes are executing code in parallel, we have to take care about race conditions and also the synchronisation of participating processes.Horovod assigns a unique numerical ID or rank (an MPI concept) to each process executing the program. This rank can be accessed programmatically. As you will see below, when writing Horovod code, by identifying a process's rank programmatically in the code, we can take steps such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pin that process to its own exclusive GPU.\n",
    "- Utilise a single rank for broadcasting values that need to be used uniformly by all ranks.\n",
    "- Utilise a single rank for collecting and/or reducing values produced by all ranks.\n",
    "- Utilise a single rank for logging or writing to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Horovod with Tensorflow, we would need to make some modifications. The modifications can be listed as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialise Horovod  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hvd.init()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pin each GPU to a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n",
    "for gpu in gpus:\n",
    "    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)\n",
    "if gpus:\n",
    "    tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[hvd.local_rank()], 'GPU')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Wrap the optimiser in Horovod Distributed optimiser. The distributed optimiser delegates gradient computation to the original optimiser, averages gradients using `all-reduce` or `all-gather`, and then applies those averaged gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "hvd.DistributedOptimizer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Broadcast the initial variable states from rank 0 to all other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is necessary to ensure consistent initialisation of all workers when training is started with random weights or restored from a checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by using the `hvd.broadcast_variables` method after models and optimisers have been initialised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Modify your code to save checkpoints only on worker 0 to prevent other workers from corrupting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now go over the modifications using a test code. \n",
    "\n",
