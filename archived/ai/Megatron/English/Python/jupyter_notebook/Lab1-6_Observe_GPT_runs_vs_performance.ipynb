    "The estimated time-to-compute which we went through in `Lab1-2_EstimateComputeDaysNeeded.ipynb` is based on the assumption that the training run will have good GPUs performance across multi-GPUs or multi-nodes jobs. Bad training configurations could result in low or inconsistent GPUs utilization, which in turn, might prolong the training run.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will cover the following: \n",

    "    1. Intro to NVIDIA profiling toolchain\n",

    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "Using the knowledge gained from going through `Lab1-2_EstimateComputeDaysNeeded.ipynb` and the profiling lecture presentations will help you to formulate strategies on training configuration in order to obtain a winning profile.\n",
