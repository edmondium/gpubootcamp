    "        The NVIDIA NGC team is hosting a webinar with live Q&A to dive into this Jupyter notebook available from the NGC catalog. Learn how to use these resources to kickstart your AI journey. Register now: NVIDIA NGC Jupyter Notebook Day: Medical Imaging Segmentation.Image segmentation partitions a digital image into multiple segments by changing the representation into something more meaningful and easier to analyze. In the field of medical imaging, image segmentation can be used to help identify organs and anomalies, measure them, classify them, and even uncover diagnostic information. It does this by using data gathered from x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and other formats.To achieve state-of-the-art models that deliver the desired accuracy and performance for a use case, you must set up the right environment, train with the ideal hyperparameters, and optimize it to achieve the desired accuracy. All of this can be time-consuming. Data scientists and developers need the right set of tools to quickly overcome tedious tasks."
