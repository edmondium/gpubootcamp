| Lab      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [End to End Computer Vision](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-Computer-Vision)      |  This repository contains the material for the end-to-end computer vision bootcamp, the goal of which is to build a complete end-to-end computer vision pipeline for an object detection application. This bootcamp will introduce participants to multiple NVIDIA® SDKs, most notably NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, NVIDIA TensorRT™, NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server, and NVIDIA DeepStream SDK. Participants will also have hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, optimization, and deployment at scale   |
| [AI Profiler](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/AI-Profiler)   |  Learn how optimizing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) training using profiling tools    |
| [End to End NLP](https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-NLP)  | This repository contains the material for the End-To-End NLP bootcamp, the goal of which is to build a complete end-to-end NLP pipeline for Question Answering application. This bootcamp will introduce participants to multiple NVIDIA® SDKs, most notably NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, NVIDIA TensorRT™, and NVIDIA RIVA. Participants will also have hands-on experience in SQuAD data preprocessing, BERT model training, optimization, and deployment at scale. |
